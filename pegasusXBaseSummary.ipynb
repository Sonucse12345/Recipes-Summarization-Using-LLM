Spray an 8x11-inch baking pan with cooking spray.; Mix panko and plain bread crumbs together in a shallow bowl. Add Creole seasoning and pepper; mix thoroughly. Beat eggs in another bowl.; Cover tenderloins in flour, then dip in egg mixture, following with a heavy coating of bread crumb mixture. Place the breaded chicken pieces in the greased pan.; Bake in the preheated oven until golden and no longer pink in the centers, about 20 minutes, turning chicken pieces halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).'"
